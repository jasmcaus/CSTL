# CSTL
The Coreten Standard Library, a neat and mini Standard Library for C.

Please note that most features in this project are **highly** experimental and *might* break pieces of your code. 
Nevertheless, it is an interesting project as it exposes the inner layers of what's always regarded as a 'black box'. 

## Usage 
Include `coreten`. That's all!
```c
#include <coreten/coreten.h>
```
