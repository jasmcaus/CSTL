# CSTL
The neatest rewrite of the C/C++ Standard Library 

Please note that most features in this project are **highly** experimental and *might* break pieces of your code. 
Nevertheless, it is an interesting project as it exposes the inner layers of what's always regarded as a 'black box'. 

## Usage 
Include `CSTL`. That's all!
```c
#include <CSTL/CSTL.h>
```

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Send in your PRs!

## License
This project is MIT-licensed in name-only. Feel free to experiment, break, copy, monetise -- basically do whatever you want with `CSTL`. Credit is optional :)
